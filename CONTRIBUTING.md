# Contributing to Transcriptase

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## All code changes happen through pull requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase and we use the [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html).

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
1. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
1. Ensure the test suite passes.
1. Make sure your code lints.
1. Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs using Github Issues]

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue [here](https://github.com/jenkins-x/terraform-google-jx/issues).

## Linting

The CI build will fail on lint issues.  To check locally run `make fmt`.

Helpful tip if using an IDE like intelij you can enable file watchers and auto format terraform files.
